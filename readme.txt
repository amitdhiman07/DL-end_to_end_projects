1. Introduction 
Diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management of diabetes are crucial for preventing complications and improving health outcomes. Machine learning algorithms offer a promising approach to diabetes prediction by analyzing medical data and identifying patterns associated with the disease.

This web application leverages machine learning models, specifically a Random Forest Classifier, to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on input features such as glucose level, BMI, and age. Users can input their medical data through a simple web interface, and the application provides instant predictions.

2. Features 
Simple and intuitive web interface for data input.
Prediction of diabetes risk based on input features.
Immediate feedback on prediction results.
Clean and professional design suitable for healthcare professionals.

3. Installation 
To run the diabetes detection web application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd diabetes-detection-web-app
Install the required dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask application:

Copy code
python app.py
Access the web application in your browser at http://localhost:5000.

4. Usage 
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000.
You will be presented with a form to input medical data.
Enter the patient's glucose level, BMI, and age into the respective fields.
Click the "Predict" button to submit the form.
The application will display the prediction result, indicating whether the patient is likely to have diabetes or not.

5. Dependencies
The diabetes detection web application relies on the following dependencies:

Flask: A web framework for Python.
scikit-learn: A machine learning library for Python.
pandas: A data manipulation and analysis library for Python.
These dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file and can be installed using pip.
