Handwritten Digit Recognition Documentation
Overview
The Mario Handwritten Digit Recognition web application is a simple tool that allows users to upload images containing handwritten digits. The application then uses a trained neural network model to predict the digit in the image. The predictions are displayed along with a Mario-themed user interface.

Features
Upload an image containing a handwritten digit.
View the uploaded image.
Receive a prediction for the handwritten digit.
Mario-themed user interface.
Usage
Access the web application through a web browser.
Click on the "Choose File" button to select an image file containing a handwritten digit (in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format).
Once the image is selected, click the "Upload Image" button.
The uploaded image will be displayed on the screen.
After a short processing time, the predicted digit will be displayed below the uploaded image.
